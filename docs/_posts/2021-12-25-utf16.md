## UTF-16

In the early days of Unicode, a 2-byte encoding called UCS-2 was proposed. This
encoding allowed for ‚Ñ¢65 536 code points to be encoded, which is enough for
plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). UCS-2 was pretty good but could not
represent all the 1 112 064 possible code points. Luckily a few unused code
points in the BMP could be put to work some clever trickery, giving birth to
UTF-16.

The range `0xD800` to `0xDFFF` (55 296 to 57 343, in decimal) was unused in
Unicode, leaving 2048 values available. This range was named the "surrogate
rage" and split in half:

- `0xD800` to `0xDBFF` is called the "high surrogate."
- `0xDC00` to `0xDFFF` is called the "low surrogate."
  
You can form a surrogate pair by combing a high surrogate with a low
surrogate. As a result, a total of 1 048 576 extra code points can be
represented by a surrogate pair.

The result is something like this:
- Code points from `0x0` to `0xFFFF` are encoded by their actual values.
- Starting from `0x10000` (which is the next number after `0xFFFF`) the code
  point is represented by a surrogate pair.

- Get the code point that needs to be represented by a surrogate pair and
  subtract 0x10000.
- The highest code point number possible, in decimal, is 1‚Åü112‚Åü064. That, minus
  `0x10000` (65‚Åü536, in decimal) is 1‚Åü046‚Åü528. Juuuust enough! This can be
  represented in 20 bits (2 ^ 20 = 1‚Åü048‚Åü576).
- The first 10 bits are added to the high surrogate, and the last 10 bits are
  added to the low surrogate.
- The high and the low 10-bit values are in the range `0x000`‚Äì`0x3FF`.


‚òÉ, snowman character, U+2603:
U+2603 < U+FFFF, hence, simply use the code point number
0x26 0x03

üçë, peach, U+1F351
U+1F351 > U+FFFF, hence, a surrogate pair is needed.
```
0x1F351 - 0x10000 = 0xF351

Split 0xF351 in 2 groups of 10 bits
0x0F351=        00 0011 1100        11 0101 0001
0xD800 = 1101 0100 0000 0000
0xDC00 =                     1101 1100 0000 0000
         1101 0100 0011 1100 1101 1111 0101 0001 = 0xD83C 0xDF51
```
